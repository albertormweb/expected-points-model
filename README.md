# expected-points-model
How to build a simple expected points (xP) model with a dataset extracted automatically from www.fbref.com

This example was developed to calculate the expected points classification in this season in the LaLiga (Spain) using this link from www.fbref.com: https://fbref.com/en/comps/12/schedule/La-Liga-Fixtures

If you want to calculate the expected points classification from another league (only men's Big 5 European Leagues), you only have to change the 'url_schedule' variable in the top of notebook. For example, use this link to calculate the xP clasiffication of the Premier League: https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/schedule/Premier-League-Fixtures
